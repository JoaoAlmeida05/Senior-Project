        <p class="one"><strong>Precis  for “Injuries in Brazilian Jiujitsu Prompt Introspection in Growing Martial Art”:</strong><br>
            In John Wiegand’s essay  “Injuries in Brazilian Jujitsu Prompt Introspection in Growing Martial Art” (Sep 21, 2023), he explains why people are getting injured practicing jiu-jitsu. 
            Wiegand develops his ideas by interviewing Gracie, who is an instructor, what are the possible ways of getting safer practice, and interviewing people who used to practice and gave up on it because of the risk of injuries and not feeling safe.
            Using as example he tells how popular this martial art is getting by talking about famous people who started practicing it, such as Joe Rogan and Mark Zuckerberg.
        <br>
            Wiengand opens his essay by explaining what jiujitsu is, and closes it by showing that there are better ways of practicing it, which proves that he addresses this article to people who are interested in starting it.

        <p class="two"><strong>Precis for “Special Issue Athletes’ Performance and Analysis in Combat Sports”:</strong><br>
            In Tadeusz Ambroszy’s essay “Special Issue Athletes’ Performance and Analysis in Combat Sports”  (2023-10-18), he explains how Martial arts can change our lives for the better, causing rapid fat loss and other benefits.
        Ambroszy develops his ideas by citing more articles that he encountered to compare how people got better after martial art.
        In order to convince people that  Martial art is something beneficial to people, he exaggerates by saying that it causes rapid weight loss, which in reality what causes weight loss is eating less calories than what you need to maintain your body weight.  
        Ambroszy’s ostensible audience is people who are interested in changing their performance or losing weight, he starts by introducing martial art to the reader and finishes it by saying the benefits of it.

            These sources talk about the observation and specialized analysis of confrontations in combat
            sports are fundamental for making corrections in training programs as well as for modifying
            individual technical–tactical profiles of athletes in such activities, The objective of the present
            study is to evaluate and compare the effect of a nutritional intervention by a sports nutritionist,
            between able-bodied athletes and athletes with physical disabilities and When Erik Milosevich
            attended his first Brazilian jujitsu class, he hoped it would spark a mutual interest to share with
            his teenage daughter. Instead, he left the gym with a limp, after injuring his left knee while sparring with an instructor, and a distaste for one of the fastest-growing martial arts for
            self-defense and competition. These sources might be useful for anyone who are interested in
            getting into jiujitsu training. This is a comprehensive source that was recently modified, and
            perhaps updated at that time. Due to this, I didn't notice any limitations for this particular source.</p><br>
