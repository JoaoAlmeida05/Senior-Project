                In John Wiegand’s essay  “Injuries in Brazilian Jujitsu Prompt Introspection in Growing Martial Art” (Sep 21, 2023), he explains why people are getting injured practicing jiu-jitsu. 
                Wiegand develops his ideas by interviewing Gracie, who is an instructor, what are the possible ways of getting safer practice, and interviewing people who used to practice and gave up on it because of the risk of injuries and not feeling safe.
                Using as example he tells how popular this martial art is getting by talking about famous people who started practicing it, such as Joe Rogan and Mark Zuckerberg.
            <br>
                Wiengand opens his essay by explaining what jiujitsu is, and closes it by showing that there are better ways of practicing it, which proves that he addresses this article to people who are interested in starting it.

                In Tadeusz Ambroszy’s essay “Special Issue Athletes’ Performance and Analysis in Combat Sports”  (2023-10-18), he explains how Martial arts can change our lives for the better, causing rapid fat loss and other benefits.
            Ambroszy develops his ideas by citing more articles that he encountered to compare how people got better after martial art.
            In order to convince people that  Martial art is something beneficial to people, he exaggerates by saying that it causes rapid weight loss, which in reality what causes weight loss is eating less calories than what you need to maintain your body weight.  
            Ambroszy’s ostensible audience is people who are interested in changing their performance or losing weight, he starts by introducing martial art to the reader and finishes it by saying the benefits of it.

            <p class="ftp">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In Fact, since I was a little kid my grandpa encouraged me to do martial arts. I practiced capoeira, karate, judo and boxing, although I do not practice it anymore, I still remember how much joy I used to have when I did. There was this time that I was interested in practicing karate and all my family did not like the idea because they believed it was something dangerous to a kid to practice, but my grandpa was against all my family and enrolled me in it, which made me feel really happy. I realized that he wanted me to be able to protect myself if needed. Martial arts is something that can connect people, bring joy, and also makes you get to know how to defend yourself which is something that is needed nowadays; but there is still the chance of getting injured during the practice. Injury is something relatively common as you are literally improving yourself, but there is always a way of practicing and not getting injured.<br><br>
    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I admire every sensei and coach I had in all my practices. They taught me not only the martial arts  and how to defend myself, but they were always giving advice for my life, helping with my decisions and my thoughts. Martial arts improves not only your physical skills, but it seeks to improve and we seek a better human being.  I do not feel interested in practicing it myself now, not because I don’t like it, but because I need to focus my energy on different things. Although nothing stops me from having  joy with it again. For now I am not seeking to practice anymore, but am focused on   weight lifting. But when I get bored of  weight lifting, I’ll definitely get back to martial arts.<br><br>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Many people think of Asia as the world of martial arts. However, this does not mean that martial arts originated in Asia. Although martial arts may not have originated in Asia, many prominent martial arts have originated in that region. Some examples of martial arts are hwa Rang do, kung fu and karate. Martial arts have been influenced by many different factors such as historical revolutions, legends and ancient myths. Due to the lack of historical records, it can be difficult to trace the history and growth of martial arts. This is especially true of older martial arts such as Indonesian pentjak silat and Hawaiian lua martial arts. Revolutions and cultural factors also threatened to eliminate certain martial arts. But it is clear from the historical records we have that martial arts has been successful. This leads me to investigate the question: how do athletes avoid injuries in mixed martial arts?<br><br>
    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is especially true when combining martial arts from two different cultures. In 2600 BC, China became the center of the martial arts universe. Emperor Huang Di, who ruled China more than 4,000 years ago, was a master of wrestling and stick fighting. He demanded that his troops learn martial arts. Around 770 AD, Mongol tribes brought skull wrestling to China. This art probably evolved into sumo. During the Qin and Han dynasties, this wrestling was combined with kemari to form shakaku. In The Art of War, Sun Tsu emphasizes the importance of the arts when it comes to fighting and living. Chinese martial arts spread to Asia Minor, Europe, and India in 500 B.C. via the Silk Road. Despite the rich history of martial arts in China, modern day martial arts originated in 527 A.D in India. Indian monk Ta Mo taught the monks of the Shaolin Temple the 18 Buddhist Fists, which turned into the Five Animal Styles of Shaolin. Tao Mo's influence influenced both Chinese and non-Chinese art.<br><br>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Temperature can have a big impact on how your body works, the highest temperature is it can make your blood to run faster, which will bring more nutrients and oxygen all over your body also makes your muscles less tight, which will bring the athlete more mobility during the practice, but it can not be so hot because it can lead to dehydration, the sweet spot would be 72 degrees. Moreno said “I get the heater on because it will help us with the flexibility and also will help us to avoid getting injured”.<br>
    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Depending on how the teacher approaches the techniques the practitioner will get better at it, which will give him the possibility to start sparring that will bring even more benefits, such as experience. But whenever they start sparring, practitioners should be aware of how rough their partners are going on them  because there are a lot of injuries that are made especially because of more experienced people trying to show off their skills and beat inexperienced people, and they will do it whenever they have the chance. Weigand, John “There is definitely a way to limit the possibilities and the high risk that you’re going to get injured when you’re brand new and guys are just literally trying to smash you and use you as practice,” Milosevich said. “There could definitely be a higher standard.”(Sep 21 2023), “Injuries in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Prompt Introspection in Growing Martial Art”.<br><br>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The mindset of an athlete can affect directly on how the athlete will outcome in a practice which is the hardest part in it, they can not get distracted by pointless things at the moment, controlling their breathing and making sure they know what their opponent is doing, it is important to keep a strong winner mindset, because if your mindset has the power to bring you down or bring you a victory it can also prevent you from injuries or not. Moreno said “the more relaxed you are the better you are gonna perform and it is hard to be relaxed when you have someone trying to choke you, but if you were able to breathe through those movements and keep calm, you are gonna eventually be able to succeed through your goal. I think the mindset is important, but it is different than being relaxed, you have to be patience, you have to be smart  and willing to to inhale and exhale and control your breath, you cannot allow about the position get into your nerve, because sometimes it will make things worse.” <br><br>
               Performing warmups and stretching increases the muscles temperature and blood flow and  loses the joints which reduces the risk of rip, tear or twist your muscles during the training. Moreno said “pretty much is hard, you try to do as much as you can to injure, but sometimes it happens, but yeah there is different type of warm ups that you can do to warm up your joints areas and specifically your hips because those are the most get impacted when you are trying to do jiu jitsu”.<br><br>
    
               &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The last thing an athlete needs to reduce the risk of injury is to have a proper diet and hydration, these two things have a really important role in recovery. They are the main source of energy the body has to make its maintenance when needed, the best quality food they take the best.  Before a practice or an actual fight, the athlete should avoid fatty food and look for carbohydrates snacks and lean sources of protein such as fish and chicken, as it has fast digestibility which will make the athlete feel lighter and faster. Moreno said “the healthier you eat and the stronger you get, less propensive fingers you are, like I say it's a combat sport, and you are looking to break joints when you are fighting, so it's gonna happen”.<br><br>
